This project explores the fundamentals of Makefiles and their usage in the context of C programming. You will delve into understanding the purpose, structure, and functionalities of Makefiles, enabling you to efficiently manage and automate the compilation process of C programs.

# Requirements
Editors: You are allowed to use vi, vim, or emacs.
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
GCC Version: 9.3.0.
Make Version: GNU Make 4.2.1.
All files should end with a new line.
Ensure the presence of a README.md file at the root of the project folder.

# Tasks Overview
This project comprises several tasks, each focusing on specific aspects of Makefile creation and usage. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

Task 0: Introduction to Makefiles - Create a basic Makefile to compile C files.
Task 1: Enhanced Makefile - Introduce variables for compiler and source files in the Makefile.
Task 2: Advanced Makefile - Further refinement with separate object files and executable name specification.
Task 3: Comprehensive Makefile - Expand the Makefile to include cleaning operations and additional functionalities.
Task 4: Complete Makefile - Finalize the Makefile by incorporating compiler flags and ensuring robustness.
Bonus Task: Island Perimeter - Implement a Python function without using modules to calculate the perimeter of an island in a grid.

For each task, you'll need to create specific files according to the task requirements. Here's a list of the files you'll need to create for each task:
* Task 0: Create your first Makefile
File to Create: 0-Makefile
* Task 1: Create a makefile with variables
File to Create: 1-Makefile
* Task 2: Create your first useful Makefile
File to Create: 2-Makefile
* Task 3: Create a Makefile with cleaning rules
File to Create: 3-Makefile
* Task 4: A complete Makefile
File to Create: 4-Makefile
* Bonus Task: Island Perimeter
File to Create: 5-island_perimeter.py
